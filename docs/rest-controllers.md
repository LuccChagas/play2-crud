## HOW-TO use dynamic REST Controllers

 * To use the dynamic REST controllers you only need to add the corresponding routing to the `conf/routes` file:

```
# REST API
->     /api             play.rest.Routes
```

 * In order to use Custom REST Controllers please check out [HOW-TO use custom REST Controllers](custom-rest-controllers.md).
